/**
 * Keeps the hand-written `.d.mts` declarations honest about the `.mjs`.
 *
 * `npm run typecheck` cannot do this. `skipLibCheck` is on, so the contents of
 * the declaration files are not verified, and the `.mjs` modules carry no JSDoc
 * so they cannot be checked as JavaScript either. That makes the declarations
 * the only description of these modules, with nothing comparing them to the
 * implementations they describe.
 *
 * This test covers the failure that actually bites: a declared export that no
 * longer exists at runtime, or a runtime export that was never declared. It
 * cannot check argument or return types — see CONTRIBUTING.md.
